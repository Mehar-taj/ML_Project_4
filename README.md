# 📖 Project Overview

This project develops a **Car Price Prediction System using Machine Learning** to estimate the selling price of used cars based on different vehicle specifications.

The model learns patterns from historical car data and predicts the resale value by analyzing important features such as:

- Manufacturing Year
- Present Price
- Kilometers Driven
- Fuel Type
- Seller Type
- Transmission Type
- Number of Previous Owners

A **Linear Regression algorithm** is used to build the prediction model because it is effective for solving regression problems where the output value is continuous.

This project represents my practical learning journey in:

- Artificial Intelligence
- Machine Learning
- Data Science
- Generative AI

The project covers the complete Machine Learning workflow including data collection, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

# 🔄 Machine Learning Workflow

## 1. Data Collection

The used car dataset was loaded for analysis and model development.

Libraries used:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn import metrics
```
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed data analysis to understand:

Dataset structure
Number of records
Data types
Missing values
Unique categories
Feature information

Example:

df.info()

df.isnull().sum()
3. Data Preprocessing

Machine Learning algorithms require numerical input, therefore categorical variables were converted into numerical values.

Encoding Categorical Features
Seller Type
Dealer → 0
Individual → 1
Fuel Type
Petrol → 0
Diesel → 1
CNG → 2
Transmission
Manual → 0
Automatic → 1
4. Feature Selection

The dataset was divided into:

Independent Features (Input)
Year
Present_Price
Kms_Driven
Fuel_Type
Seller_Type
Transmission
Owner
Dependent Feature (Target)
Selling_Price

Code:

X = df.drop(['Car_Name','Selling_Price'],axis=1)

Y = df['Selling_Price']
5. Train-Test Split

The dataset was divided into training and testing data.

Dataset	Percentage
Training Data	80%
Testing Data	20%

Code:

X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(
    X,
    Y,
    test_size=0.2,
    random_state=2
)
🤖 Machine Learning Model
Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to predict continuous numerical values.

In this project, it learns the relationship between car features and selling price to estimate the resale value of vehicles.

Advantages:

✔ Simple and efficient
✔ Easy to understand
✔ Works well for regression problems
✔ Provides continuous predictions

🚀 Model Training

The Linear Regression model was trained using the training dataset.

model = LinearRegression()

model.fit(X_train,Y_train)
📊 Model Evaluation

The model performance was evaluated using:

R² Score

R² Score measures how well the model explains the variation in the target variable.

Code:

training_prediction = model.predict(X_train)

metrics.r2_score(
    training_prediction,
    Y_train
)

Testing:

test_prediction = model.predict(X_test)

metrics.r2_score(
    test_prediction,
    Y_test
)
🚗 Car Price Prediction

The trained model predicts the selling price of a new vehicle based on user input.

Example:

Input
(2014,3.35,27000,0,0,0,0)
Output
Predicted Car Price: ₹X Lakhs
📈 Results

The model successfully predicts used car prices based on vehicle specifications.

The Linear Regression model demonstrates that Machine Learning can be effectively used for automobile price estimation.
